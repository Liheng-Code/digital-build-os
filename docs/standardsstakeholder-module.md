## DCOS Stakeholder Module Standard

---

### 1. Design Goal

Stakeholder module must feel like a control panel for responsibility.

It is not a contact list.  
It is not a CRM.  
It is not for storing names only.  

It is a system to control:
- Who is responsible
- Who approves
- Who executes
- Who is accountable

---

### 2. Core Layout

Use this layout as default:

Sidebar + Top Bar + Main Workspace + Detail Panel

---



Stakeholder module located under:

Administration → Stakeholder Management

---

### 4. Screen Structure

#### 4.1 Left Panel — Stakeholder Type Filter

Purpose:
Quick classification and filtering

Display:

- All Stakeholders
- Client / Owner
- Consultant
- Subcontractor
- Supplier
- Authority
- Testing Agency

Rules:

- Show count per type
- Active filter highlight
- Fast switching (no reload delay)

---

#### 4.2 Top Bar — Control Actions

Include:

- Search (organization / contact / role)
- Filter button
- Add Stakeholder button

Rules:

- Search must be instant

---

#### 4.3 Main Workspace — Stakeholder Register

Display as table/list:

Columns:

- Organization Name
- Stakeholder Type
- Contact Person
- Project Role
- Approval Level
- Status

Rules:

- Clean row spacing

---

---

### 6. Interaction Flow

#### Create Stakeholder

Create stakeholder  
→ Select type  
→ Input organization info  
→ Add contact  
→ Save  

---

#### Assign to Project

Select stakeholder  
→ Assign project  
→ Define role  
→ Define approval level  
→ Define access  
→ Assign WBS (optional)  
→ Activate  

---

### 7. Workflow Rules

- Stakeholder must exist before assignment
- Stakeholder must be assigned before workflow
- Approval cannot proceed without assigned approver
- Every action must link to stakeholder

---

### 8. Notification Behavior

System must notify based on role:

- Task assigned → Engineer
- Task overdue → Engineer + PM
- RFI created → Consultant
- RFI overdue → Consultant + Director
- PO approved → Supplier

Rules:

- No spam
- Only relevant users
- Critical alerts escalate

---

### 9. UX Rules

- No unnecessary animation
- No fancy colors
- No social-style UI

Design must feel like:

A construction control room

Not a marketing app

---

### 10. Data Integrity Rules

- No duplicate stakeholder in same project
- Approval level must be defined
- External users must have limited access
- All actions logged in audit log

---

### 11. Integration

This module must connect to:

- Project Module
- WBS Module
- Task Module
- Document Control
- Procurement
- QA/QC
- Notification System
- Audit Log

---

### 12. MVP Scope

Start with:

- Stakeholder register
- Project assignment
- Role & permission
- Basic approval logic

Do NOT overbuild early.

---

### 13. Final Principle

If this module is weak:

→ System becomes chaos

If this module is strong:

→ Project becomes controlled
